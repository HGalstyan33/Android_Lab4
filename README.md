## Lab 4

### App Description
Along with the features from the previous labs, this app now has sliding transitions between main activity and flashcard activity, as well as between different flashcards. There is also a countdown timer for each question, and if it reaches 0, it will reveal the answer to the question. Alongside that, there is a shuffle option to randomize the order of the answer options. Lastly, when the correct answer is pressed, a celebratory animation will play.
